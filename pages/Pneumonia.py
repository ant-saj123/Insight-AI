A chest X-ray produces an image of the chest, including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, and bones. In the case of pneumonia, the lungs may appear cloudy or hazy, indicating fluid or inflammation in the air spaces within the lungs. This fluid accumulation can make it difficult for oxygen to pass from the air sacs of the lungs into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. The datasets collected chest X-ray images of Normal and Pneumonia affected patients and every image was verified. It has two outputs labeled as Normal and Pneumonia. ")

Pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and symptoms may include cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and muscle aches. In some cases, people may also experience sweating, rapid breathing, and confusion. Treatment for pneumonia depends on the cause of the infection, and can include antibiotics, antiviral drugs, or supportive care such as oxygen therapy. Vaccination can also help prevent pneumonia.

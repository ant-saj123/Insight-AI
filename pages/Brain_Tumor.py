Th pituitary gland regulates the production and release of hormones that control various bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproductive processes. Pituitary tumors can either be functional or non-functional, depending on whether they produce excess hormones or not. Symptoms of a putuitary tuomr may include headaches, vision changes, hormonal imbalances, and decreased ability to produce certain hormones.
